This is our custom frontend for our media server based on the Jellyfin-vue client. It will be kept up-to-date with the origin, so expect merges whenever they are pushed at origin. Aside from that, we will also add our own changes:

- Cosmetic changes to align with the sluthub branding
- Preferential changes like sortings or excludes for certain media-types
- Small logic fixes that wont affect the end-user, and wont make merging complicated

You can check for all those changes [here](https://github.com/Sluthub/sluthub-vue/commits/master/?author=ClaraCrazy)

## ‚ù§Ô∏è Support me

<!--
Pwease support me >.<

<p>Since I work full-time on open-source projects spread across my organizations, my only source of income is donations from people like you that use & appreciate my stuff. So, if you can spare a dollar or two, I would really appreciate that. All the money goes towards paying rent, essentials like food, drinks etc, and most importantly it will be used to fuel my cookie addictionüç™<br></p>
